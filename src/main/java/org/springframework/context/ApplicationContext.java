/**
 * Central interface to provide configuration for an application.
 * This is read-only while the application is running, but may be
 * reloaded if the implementation supports this.
 *
 * <p>An ApplicationContext provides:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Bean factory methods for accessing application components.
 * Inherited from {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.ListableBeanFactory}.
 * <li>The ability to load file resources in a generic fashion.
 * Inherited from the {@link org.springframework.core.io.ResourceLoader} interface.
 * <li>The ability to publish events to registered listeners.
 * Inherited from the {@link ApplicationEventPublisher} interface.
 * <li>The ability to resolve messages, supporting internationalization.
 * Inherited from the {@link MessageSource} interface.
 * <li>Inheritance from a parent context. Definitions in a descendant context
 * will always take priority. This means, for example, that a single parent
 * context can be used by an entire web application, while each servlet has
 * its own child context that is independent of that of any other servlet.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>In addition to standard {@link org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanFactory}
 * lifecycle capabilities, ApplicationContext implementations detect and invoke
 * {@link ApplicationContextAware} beans as well as {@link ResourceLoaderAware},
 * {@link ApplicationEventPublisherAware} and {@link MessageSourceAware} beans.
